# E-LEARNING-PLATFORM-UI

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: SELVA NANDHINI S

INTERN ID: CT04DG3334

DOMAIN: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

This project, titled "LearnX", is a fully responsive and visually appealing online learning platform that aims to simulate a real-world EdTech website. The purpose behind building LearnX was to understand and implement core front-end development concepts while also practicing proper design principles and user interaction strategies. It allows users to explore and enroll in various online courses. The platform is informative, clean, and professional in layout, giving users an authentic learning experience similar to popular platforms like Coursera or Udemy.

Description of the Project:
The LearnX website features multiple pages with organized sections, including a landing page, course listings, a detailed course view, and a contact section. The homepage includes a hero section with a call-to-action encouraging users to “Start Learning,” paired with statistics showing platform credibility (like number of learners, courses completed, and partners). Below that, the “Why Choose LearnX?” section highlights key features such as Industry-Relevant Content, Real Progress Tracking, and Interactive Course Structure — all crafted to emphasize value to potential users.

The course page showcases a categorized list of available topics including HTML & CSS, JavaScript Basics, React.js, Python Programming, SQL for Databases, and Node.js. These course cards are interactive and neatly laid out, providing a “Start Learning” button for each.

When a specific course is selected, users are directed to a detailed view page. This includes a course-related YouTube video (embedded directly), as well as a progress bar to track course completion—mimicking functionality used by actual e-learning platforms.

Tools & Technologies Used:
This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

HTML5:
HTML served as the skeleton of the project, laying out the structure and content of each webpage. It was used to build semantic, accessible markup for all key components such as navigation bars, course sections, footers, and call-to-action buttons.

CSS3:
Styling was done using CSS, which provided the layout, color gradients, typography, and responsive design. CSS Flexbox and Grid were particularly useful in making the layout mobile-friendly and adaptive across screen sizes.

JavaScript (Basic):
JavaScript was used to add interactivity such as the filtering of course categories and updating the progress bar. It ensures users can dynamically view content without needing to reload the page.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
VS Code was the primary code editor used in this project. It provided support for live server preview, extensions for formatting, and syntax highlighting that enhanced productivity.

Google Fonts & Icons:
The aesthetic and typography of the site were improved using Google Fonts, and icons were either SVG-based or sourced from libraries to maintain modern UI trends.

YouTube Embed:
Videos were embedded using YouTube’s iframe API, which allowed for clean integration of video tutorials directly into the course detail pages.

Browser (Chrome/Brave):
The website was tested and previewed using Brave Browser (based on Chromium). Browser DevTools were heavily utilized to debug layout issues, inspect elements, and test responsiveness.

Features:
Clean User Interface: The layout is minimal and professional, with clear headings, spacing, and navigation.

Responsiveness: The site works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Course Filtering: Buttons allow users to filter courses based on categories like Frontend, Backend, Data Science, etc.

Progress Bar: A course completion bar is available for user progress simulation.

Embedded Video Content: Direct access to YouTube-based educational videos enhances user experience.

Final Thoughts:
This project not only tested my ability to apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a real-world scenario but also taught me how to think about user experience and visual hierarchy. From structuring the layout to implementing interactive elements, every decision was made to ensure the platform looks authentic and is intuitive to use. Though simple in functionality, it successfully demonstrates the core principles behind modern e-learning web platforms.

Overall, LearnX is a great foundation project for anyone interested in front-end web development or looking to build their portfolio with a clean and structured educational site.
